1. requirements 

a) what fields/variables/trade granuality do we need and are we getting from each source(gdax,polonix,etc...)

for example:

data_source,timestamp,asset_name,asset_open_value,asset_close_value,etc...

gdax,bitcon,2017-03-21T23:13:18Z,$4200.00,4250.00,....
gdax,bitcon,2017-03-21T23:13:18Z,$4200.00,4250.00,....

These will be inputs to machine learning algorithms
b) what to do with missing data (empty strings, null, N/A, no data for that time) 
* skip record
* estimate based on last 3 records
* actually use missing data as another signal 



2. write a scrappers for

a) gdax
b) polonix
c) kraken
d) bitfinx
e) bittex
f) (bloomberg, juno trader, ninja whichever is cheapest) 


g) make all to output in timeseries CSV file and also a equal length arrays with same columms 

Feel free to make changes.
